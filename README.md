# üåæ Stardew Valley Farmhand - RAG Assistant

A comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help Stardew Valley players find accurate information from the game's wiki. This project demonstrates RAG techniques including hybrid search, multiple retrieval strategies, and comprehensive evaluation methodologies.

## üéØ Problem Description

Stardew Valley is a complex farming simulation game with extensive mechanics, items, relationships, and strategies. Players often need quick access to specific information about:

- **Crop growing seasons and profitability**
- **Fishing locations and techniques** 
- **Mining strategies and ore locations**
- **Relationship building with NPCs**
- **Crafting recipes and materials**
- **Quest completion strategies**

The official [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com) contains vast amounts of information, but finding specific answers requires navigating through multiple pages and sections. This RAG application solves this problem by:

1. **Processing and indexing** the entire Stardew Valley wiki into a searchable knowledge base
2. **Providing instant, accurate answers** to player questions using advanced retrieval techniques
3. **Supporting multiple search strategies** (dense vectors, sparse vectors, hybrid search)
4. **Evaluating and optimizing** retrieval and generation quality through comprehensive testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Retrieval Flow
The application implements a sophisticated retrieval pipeline that combines:

- **Knowledge Base**: Qdrant vector database containing processed Stardew Valley wiki content
- **Dense Vectors**: Jina AI embeddings (jina-embeddings-v2-small-en) for semantic similarity
- **Sparse Vectors**: BM25 for keyword-based matching
- **Hybrid Search**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combining both approaches
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT models for answer generation

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Web Scraping**: Automated extraction of [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com) content
2. **Content Processing**: Text and table summarization using LLMs
3. **Vectorization**: Dual embedding generation (dense + sparse)
4. **Storage**: Qdrant vector database with hybrid search capabilities

## üîç Retrieval Evaluation

The project implements comprehensive retrieval evaluation across multiple approaches:

### Multiple Retrieval Strategies
- **Dense Vector Search**: Semantic similarity using Jina embeddings
- **Sparse Vector Search**: BM25 keyword matching
- **Hybrid Search**: RRF fusion of dense and sparse results
- **Multi-stage Search**: Prefetching with re-ranking

### Evaluation Metrics
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Measures ranking quality
- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of queries with correct answers in top-k results
- **Automated Question Generation**: LLM-generated evaluation questions from wiki content
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side evaluation of different retrieval approaches

## ü§ñ LLM Evaluation

The application includes sophisticated LLM evaluation capabilities:

### Model Comparison
- **Multiple Model Support**: GPT-5,GPT-5-Mini, GPT-5-Nano, GPT-4o, 
- **Automated Evaluation**: LLM judge comparing model outputs
- **Quality Assessment**: Relevance scoring and explanation generation

## üìä Ingestion Pipeline

### Automated Data Processing
The project implements a fully automated ingestion pipeline:

- **Web Scraping**: Automated extraction from [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com)
- **Content Processing**: LLM-based summarization of text and tables
- **Vector Generation**: Automated embedding creation for both dense and sparse vectors
- **Database Population**: Batch processing and storage in Qdrant

### Detailed Processing Steps

1. **Data Extraction**: We extracted the data from the Stardew Valley Wiki website
2. **HTML Processing**: Used the `unstructured` Python library to partition the HTML files
3. **Content Chunking**: Applied multiple criteria to chunk the content effectively
4. **Content Classification**: Extracted both text and table chunks from the processed data
5. **Table Summarization**: Table chunks were fed into an LLM to generate summaries
6. **Vector Storage**: Summarized content was stored in the vector database for retrieval

### Pipeline Components
- **Data Ingestion Script**: `scripts/data_ingest.py` for automated processing
- **Vector Store Pipeline**: `scripts/vector_store.py` for database setup
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Content Type Classification**: Automatic categorization of text vs. table content
- **LLM Summarization**: Automated table summarization using language models

## üìà Monitoring & Evaluation

### Evaluation Dashboard
