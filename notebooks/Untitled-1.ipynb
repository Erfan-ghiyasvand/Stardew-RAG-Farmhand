      "1.4 : Slingshots can now be put in the inventory trash bin on computer and console (Mobile already had this ability). Added Dark Sword to obtainable items.\n",
      "1.5 : Slingshots can now be purchased at the Adventurer's Guild after unlocking. Added Elf Blade , Femur , Kudgel , Shadow Dagger , and Yeti Tooth to obtainable items. Added additional weapons. Changed weapon level calculation. This results in lower weapon levels and sell prices for most weapons with the exceptions of Clubs. Bug where weapon defense had no effect fixed.\n",
      "1.6 : All marriage candidate's weapons are now available during the Desert Festival , when they are running a stall. Updated Holy Blade stats and make it obtainable. Added Meowmere . Extended the area of effect of downward facing melee attacks (and slightly extended the side attack of daggers).\n",
      "1.6.9 : Fixed bug where holding a weapon while forging another weapon would delete the held weapon.\n"
